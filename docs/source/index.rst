GPP Client Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the documentation for the **GPP Python Client**, a modern, asynchronous client built to interact with GPP, without the GraphQL.

The GPP Client provides a clean, extensible way to manage GPP resources like programs, observations, targets, and more through a Pythonic interface.
